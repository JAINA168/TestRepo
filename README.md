To achieve global resiliency with Amazon Connect, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Replica Instance**: Use the `ReplicateInstance` API to create a replica of your existing Amazon Connect instance in another AWS region. Note that this feature is available only in specific regions, such as US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (London). You can only create a replica in certain pairs of regions, for example, from US East to US West or from Europe (London) to Europe (Frankfurt)[1][7].

2. **Set Up a Traffic Distribution Group**: Create a Traffic Distribution Group (TDG) using the `CreateTrafficDistributionGroup` API. This group allows you to link Amazon Connect instances across different AWS regions and manage the distribution of telephony traffic between them[1][6].

3. **Claim and Manage Phone Numbers**: Once your TDG is active, claim phone numbers to it using the `ClaimPhoneNumber` API. You can then assign these phone numbers to multiple instances across AWS regions using the `UpdatePhoneNumber` API[1][7].

4. **Distribute Traffic**: Use the `UpdateTrafficDistribution` API to manage how telephony traffic is distributed across linked instances. You can adjust the distribution in 10% increments, allowing for gradual shifts or immediate changes depending on your needs[1][7].

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Continuously monitor the status of your traffic distribution group with the `DescribeTrafficDistributionGroup` API to ensure it remains active and functioning correctly. Make adjustments as necessary based on performance and regional demand[1].

By implementing these steps, you can ensure that your Amazon Connect call center is resilient across multiple regions, providing high availability and reliability for customer interactions globally.
