## Amazon Connect Terraform Implementation: Flows, Queues, and Routing Profiles

Below is detailed, **separate content** for managing Amazon Connect **Contact Flows**, **Queues**, and **Routing Profiles** using Terraform Cloud, with configuration and JSON files as shown in your attached project structure[1].

---

## **Contact Flows**

**Purpose:**  
Contact flows define the logic for customer interactions in Amazon Connect (e.g., IVR menus, call routing, etc.).

**JSON Storage:**  
- Each flow is represented as a JSON file (e.g., `outbound_flow.json`, `sample_tf_flow.json`) in the `contact_flows` directory within your project structure[1].

**Terraform Usage:**  
- Use the `aws_connect_contact_flow` resource.
- Reference the JSON file using the `file()` function and assign its content to the `content` argument.

**Example:**

```hcl
resource "aws_connect_contact_flow" "example" {
  instance_id = var.instance_id
  name        = "Outbound Flow"
  type        = "CONTACT_FLOW"
  content     = file("${path.module}/contact_flows/outbound_flow.json")
  description = "Outbound contact flow"
  tags        = var.tags
}
```
- The `content` argument expects the JSON definition exported from Amazon Connect or via the AWS CLI[2][3].
- Each flow is managed as code, and changes to the JSON file will trigger Terraform updates.

---

## **Queues**

**Purpose:**  
Queues are "waiting areas" for contacts before they are routed to agents. They are critical for managing call distribution and agent workload.

**JSON Storage:**  
- Each queue is defined in a JSON file (e.g., `inbound_queue.json`, `outbound_queue.json`) under the `contact_queues` directory[1].

**Terraform Usage:**  
- Use the `aws_connect_queue` resource.
- Reference queue attributes (name, description, hours of operation, etc.) from the decoded JSON.

**Example:**

```hcl
locals {
  inbound_queue = jsondecode(file("${path.module}/contact_queues/inbound_queue.json"))
}

resource "aws_connect_queue" "inbound" {
  instance_id          = var.instance_id
  name                 = local.inbound_queue.name
  description          = local.inbound_queue.description
  hours_of_operation_id = local.inbound_queue.hours_of_operation_id
  max_contacts         = local.inbound_queue.max_contacts
  tags                 = var.tags
}
```
- Ensure all required fields (name, hours of operation, etc.) are present in the JSON[4][5].

---

## **Routing Profiles**

**Purpose:**  
Routing profiles link queues to agents and define which channels (voice, chat, etc.) and priorities apply. Each agent is assigned one routing profile, and each profile can include multiple queues[6][7][8].

**JSON Storage:**  
- Routing profiles are stored as JSON files (e.g., `routing_profile.json`, `routing_profiles.json`) in the `routing_profiles` directory[1].

**Terraform Usage:**  
- Use the `aws_connect_routing_profile` resource.
- Reference the JSON file, and use its properties for configuration.

**Example:**

```hcl
locals {
  routing_profile = jsondecode(file("${path.module}/routing_profiles/routing_profile.json"))
}

resource "aws_connect_routing_profile" "profile" {
  instance_id               = var.instance_id
  name                      = local.routing_profile.name
  description               = local.routing_profile.description
  default_outbound_queue_id = local.routing_profile.default_outbound_queue_id
  queue_configs {
    queue_id    = local.routing_profile.queue_configs[0].queue_id
    priority    = local.routing_profile.queue_configs[0].priority
    delay       = local.routing_profile.queue_configs[0].delay
    channel     = local.routing_profile.queue_configs[0].channel
  }
  media_concurrencies {
    channel     = local.routing_profile.media_concurrencies[0].channel
    concurrency = local.routing_profile.media_concurrencies[0].concurrency
  }
  tags = var.tags
}
```
- The `queue_configs` and `media_concurrencies` blocks are populated from the JSON, allowing you to manage queue priorities and channel concurrency per routing profile[6][7][8].

---

## **Best Practices & Workflow**

- **Modularization:** Reference reusable modules from a central repository for consistency.
- **Separation of Data and Logic:** Store all flows, queues, and routing profiles as JSON for easy editing and review.
- **Terraform Cloud Integration:** Connect your GitHub repo to a Terraform Cloud workspace; changes to JSON or Terraform files trigger automated plans and applies.
- **Environment Isolation:** Each environment (e.g., `projectA/us-east-1`, `projectB/us-west-2`) has its own folder and state, as shown in your structure[1].

## **Summary Table**

| Component      | Directory & Example File                | Terraform Resource                | Notes                                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Contact Flows  | `contact_flows/outbound_flow.json`     | `aws_connect_contact_flow`        | JSON content passed as `content`           |
| Queues         | `contact_queues/inbound_queue.json`    | `aws_connect_queue`               | JSON decoded, fields mapped to attributes  |
| Routing Profiles| `routing_profiles/routing_profile.json`| `aws_connect_routing_profile`     | JSON decoded, includes queue configs       |

---

This approach ensures that each Amazon Connect component is managed independently, version-controlled, and can be updated or rolled back as needed, all while leveraging the power of Terraform Cloud automation and GitHub collaboration.
